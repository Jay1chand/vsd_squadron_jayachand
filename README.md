## Task 1:

Firstly, I have downloaded the virtual box from the links provided to us and
loaded a linux version with image dock file sent, Then I have successfully run the
virtual machine and compiled the tasks.

Initial task is:-

### write a program to compile the sum of first n natural numbers in c:

This is the code to run in terminal to get output:

A program is run to obtain risc-v version of the code previously written in c:

As the whole version of above code looks lengthier with different commands, we have obtained the required main 
part to compare the execution in assembly language:

## Task 2:

For this task, we are instructed to observe the spike simulation and understand the execution of assembly code using -o1 and -ofast directives, I understood the principle
and working of the whole program and how various registers like stack pointer and r5 are increasing, understood how the interface explains the process itself.
